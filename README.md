# our_google
☞ google home page in our style !
• We created a google homepage using html and added styles to it using css.
• This will direct the user to google actual search when user clicks on search button.
• This project has 5 pages in total.
    1) Home : This page is search page in  which we will be able to search for anything which will connect us to google directly.
    2) Advanced search : this is similar to google's advanced search but with more design and less functionality compared to that.
    3) Image search : we will be able to search for images using this page but again this will also connect us to google.
    4) Game page : on image search page and normal search page you will be able to see a play button which will take you to this page in which you can wait for sometime playing a game that is count. In this you can click on count and you will get thank you message for counting till multiples of 10. Java script used to code this game 
    5) Contact details : This actually contain 2 pages since we are two people who worked on this. These two pages contain our complete details including social media account links.
• Central idea of this page is to create a neat and clean user interface which gives a pleasant experience for user while using google search.
